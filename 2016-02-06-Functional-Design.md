[Description: The Design Planning Summary section provides an overview of this specific development project, a synopsis of the situation that led to the need, and a short description of the issues that the development project is going to solve, as well as a general description of the proposed solution and the rationale for the solution.  Any attempts to resolve the issue through other means should also be noted and explained.]

Our goal is to make our users more effective agents by presenting social content that is relevant and actionable based on the user's own estimation of value. We discuss the relationship between attention, value, and social agency in order to motivate the central mechanisms for content flow on the network.

## **_Content Design_**

The process of creating and maintaining a consistent and appropriate voice of the product to support the needs of the users.

**Output**

Needs of the users.
